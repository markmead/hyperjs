title: Alert Close Auto with Life
---

<Example src="alert-close-auto-with-life" />

Avoid doing this with JavaScript, instead use CSS. In this example I'm using Tailwind CSS:

```
theme: {
  extend: {
    keyframes: {
      life: {
        "0%": { width: "100%" },
        "100%": { width: "0%" },
      },
    },
    animation: {
      life: "life 4750ms linear forwards",
    },
  },
},
```

As a personal preference, I've set the animation to finish before the alert auto closes.
