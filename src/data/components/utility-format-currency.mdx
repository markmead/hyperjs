title: How to format currency
group: utility
---

This uses the plugin Alpine JS [x-money](https://github.com/markmead/alpinejs-money) which allows you to take a value such as **1999** and turn it into a formatted, localized currency such as **£19.99**.

It also works with Shopify through the `.shopify` modifier which will read the global Shopify object set on the window via `window.Shopify`.
