title: How to read and delete from local storage
group: storage
---

An extension to the official Alpine JS [$persist](https://alpinejs.dev/plugins/persist) plugin, the magic methods `$persistGet` and `$persistDelete` have been added through the [persist extended](https://alpinejs.dev/plugins/persist) plugin for easier local storage management.

These allow you to read and delete data from local storage. Additionally, there's a `@persist:delete` method that is triggered when data is deleted from local storage.
