title: How to use variable interpolation like React, Vue or Angular

Ever wanted to be able to use Alpine JS but use React, Vue or Angular approach to rendering dynamic content? Something like:

```html
<div x-data="{ name: 'Eric Green' }">
  <!-- React-->
  <p>{name}</p>

  <!-- Vue-->
  <p>{{ name}}</p>

  <!-- Angular -->
  <p>{{name}}</p>
</div>
```
