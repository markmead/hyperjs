title: Read and Delete from Local Storage
group: storage

If all you need is the ability to save values to local storage then the [standard storage](/examples/storage) example is all you need. However, if you ever thought:

> Wouldn't it be cool if I could read and delete stuff from local storage as well

Then the Alpine JS [persist extended plugin](https://github.com/markmead/alpinejs-persist-extended) is what you're after. It has two magic methods:

- `$persistGet` which allows you to read data from local storage
- `$persistDelete` which allows you to delete data from local storage

With the addition of the `@persist:delete` event which you can hook into and use to update the page when a value in local storage is deleted.

<Callout>
  Make some changes and refresh the page to see your changes saved.
</Callout>
